<#
        .SYNOPSIS
        This script is inteded to be ran after a CB Protection server update to copy the installers to a separate web server
        .DESCRIPTION
        For this script, it is assumed you have an architecture where the CB Protection server is only accessible by the agents on the default communication port.
        In this scenario, 443 access is blocked from the outside to protect the console from outside access. Due to this, an external webserver is needed to host the
        update files to allow the agents to still update normally after the server version has updated. For more information on this architecture, please consult the
        CB Protection document 'Cb Protection - Always-Connected Agents.pdf'.
